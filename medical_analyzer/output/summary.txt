**Patient Summary:** Your test results show that your hemoglobin level is 12.8 g/dL, which is slightly low and indicative of mild anemia, meaning your blood might not have enough healthy red blood cells. Your fasting glucose level is 132 mg/dL, which is elevated and may indicate impaired glucose tolerance, suggesting some difficulty in handling sugar. Additionally, your total cholesterol level is 220 mg/dL, which is higher than the recommended level of less than 200 mg/dL. Your LDL (bad cholesterol) is also elevated at 130 mg/dL, which can increase your risk for heart issues. Moreover, your triglycerides level is borderline high at 150 mg/dL. It's a good idea to talk with your doctor about these findings and discuss potential lifestyle changes such as modifications in your diet and exercise to improve your health.
